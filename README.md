# Autonomous Vehicle Simulation with CARLA

This project focuses on the development and validation of autonomous driving systems using the CARLA simulator. It explores trajectory planning algorithms like A* and RRT, along with vehicle control methods such as the Stanley method, in an urban simulation environment.

## Installation

To set up this project, you'll need to have CARLA Simulator installed along with Python 3.x. Clone the repository and install the required Python dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gcallj/TCC_CARLA_SIM.git
cd TCC_CARLA_SIM
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Features
